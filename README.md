```

* `public` contains all of the HTML, CSS, and client side JavaScript. 
* `sass` contains all of the sass files. 
* `server` contains all of the server side and database code.
  * `server.js` is the entry point to the application. This connects the routes to the database.
  * `apiRoutes.js` and `userRoutes.js` are responsible for any HTTP requests to `/users/something` or `/api/something`. 
  * `json` is a directory that contains a bunch of dummy data in `.json` files.
  * `database.js` is responsible for all queries to the database. It doesn't currently connect to any database, all it does is return data from `.json` files.
